- Open a terminal (gnome-terminal) and change shortcut for zooming in from Ctrl-+ to Ctrl-=
- Install MEGA
- Install KeePassXC
- Install dropbox
- Install Zim Desktop wiki and point to dropbox's TechNotesCreate directories:

Create dir:
~/repos		(all repos go here, incl. 'settings', 'programs', 'bitcoin-textbook' !!)
~/local/bin	(copy all scripts here, like todo.sh for tmux, etc. - include to $PATH)
~/local/lib	(create and just install all non-packaged software here)

Running MEGA will sync 'mine' and 'other' folders (will clean these to a better structure)
~/MEGA/mine	(personal stuff that need to be sync'ed / backed up !! )
~/MEGA/other	(other stuff that need to be sync'ed / backed up !! )

(remember we still have gDrive for presentations and other stuff like logistika, etc)
(remember we still have dropbox for TechNotes and pw files)
