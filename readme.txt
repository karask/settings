Create directories:

~/work		(all repos go here, incl. 'settings' ! :-)
~/mine		(personal stuff that are sync'ed / backuped !! )

~/local/bin	(copy all scripts here, like todo.sh for tmux, etc. - include to $PATH)
~/local/lib	(create and just install all non-packaged software here)


Also:
- Open a terminal (gnome-terminal) and change shortcut for zooming in from Ctrl-+ to Ctrl-=
